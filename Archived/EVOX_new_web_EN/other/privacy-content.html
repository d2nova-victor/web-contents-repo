	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<div class="privacy-section">
		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">E2 Nova provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the EVOX Service and App. If you do not agree to our practices, please do not use the Service.

		This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the EVOX Terms of Use. Your use of the EVOX Service and App and any personal information you provide on the EVOX Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

		<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>

		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">This Privacy Policy is part of EVOX Terms of Use and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information, obtained by EVOX, including information obtained when you access the EVOX Site, use the EVOX Service or any other software provided by E2 Nova.

		This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that E2 Nova does not own or control, or to individuals whom E2 Nova does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which E2 Nova may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

		<h2>The Information E2 Nova Collects</h2>

		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">E2 Nova may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below (“Personally Identifying Information”):</p>

		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">User Provided Information: You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable), billing information (if applicable) and mobile device information to E2 Nova when choosing to participate in various uses of the E2 Nova Service, such as registering as a user of EVOX Service, updating your status or requesting status for your contacts. In order to provide the EVOX Service, E2 Nova will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other EVOX users (“in-network” numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as “out-network” numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.</p>

		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">Cookies Information: When you visit the EVOX Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. E2 Nova uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the EVOX Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>

		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">Log File Information: When you use the EVOX Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the status of and various status information. When you use the EVOX Service, our servers log certain general information that our application sends whenever a message is sent or received, or if you update or request any status information, including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were sent from and to.</p>

		<h2>The Information E2 Nova Does Not Collect</h2>
		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">E2 Nova does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers—the EVOX App will associate whatever name the EVOX user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list — and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on EVOX’s servers and is not transmitted to EVOX. This means that if you have your friend’s mobile phone number associated with the name “Vincent” in your mobile address book, that’s the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your EVOX contact list. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with other users via the EVOX Service.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="privacy-section">
		<h2>The Way E2 Nova Uses Information</h2>
		<p class="pravicy-paragraph">If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the EVOX Site, or EVOX Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the EVOX Site and EVOX Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the EVOX Service and will be retained. Any billing information that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with EVOX. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the EVOX Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the EVOX Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your status messages through the EVOX Service and other users may contact you through the EVOX Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major EVOX Site or EVOX Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the EVOX Site and EVOX Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. We may use cookies and log file information to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the EVOX Service or EVOX Site;</li>
			<li>(b) provide custom, personalized content and information; </li>
			<li>(c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and </li>
			<li>(d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</li>
		</ul>
