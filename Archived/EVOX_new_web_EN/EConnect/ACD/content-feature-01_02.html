			<h2>Call <span class="purple-text">queuing</span> and <span class="purple-text">distribution</span></h2>
			<p>Customer calls will arrive in waves, such as during lunch break or right after the office open etc. So there will never be enough agents to answer all calls at all times. <br/><br/>Call queuing allows high volume of calls to be smoothed out by putting callers in a queue until an agent is freed up.And if more than one agent is free, the call distribution mechanism will select the agent according to the selected algorithm to make sure the workload is evenly spread out across the service team. <br/><br/>When the system or support team is overloaded, the system also offers the caller the option to leave a message (typically to request a call back) or to simply call back at a later time so they are not left waiting in “IVR purgatory.”</p>
